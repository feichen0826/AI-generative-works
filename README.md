Background:
The idea behind this project was to leverage machine learning to sample my personal artistic style onto different images. The original image I used as the basis for style transfer was a personal work of art, hand-drawn using Photoshop and a Wacom board. While the goal was to keep the artwork simple and focused on creating usable textures rather than high resolution, the primary objective was to delve into the world of machine learning, gain a deeper understanding of its concepts, and explore innovative ways to generate content.

Technology Stack:
To implement this project, I utilized TensorFlow, an open-source platform for machine learning developed by the Google Brain team. TensorFlow provides developers with a comprehensive suite of tools, libraries, and a supportive community to build and deploy machine learning-powered applications.
